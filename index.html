        <p>
             I am GOlla Teja pursuing final B-Tech of Mechanical 
             engineering at sree vidyanikethan engineering college.I am interested  in learning new technologies and new skills.
             I love programming with python and  i have little grip on  SQL , and also im interested in bulding website with clear code  by using html & css , just 
             iam a begineer in this . Coming to the accademic part currently i'm having 88.39%  score in my B-Tech. I done by intermediate in sree
             vivekananda junior college with aggrigate percentage of 94.5%. I am a 3D modeling designer and have more grip on Creo , Fusion 360 , Ansys Simulation soft wares.

        <h5>
            Abstract
            </h5>
        <P>
            To minimize the work effort and labour effort in farming while planting. Generally in
farming, farmers are facing so many problems.one of the major issue in that ,they are facing
difficulty while planting in the field.
 For example while planting tomato and mirchi and some other plants, they want labours and
they want to pay more physical effort while doing that work.So, for that purpose we want to
minimize the efforts of labour and investing of money. Through this project we will give
solution to the farmers who are working hard.
For this project for achieving best performance from a seed planter. Thus we, need to make
proper design of the agriculture machine and also selection of the components is also required
on the machine to suit the needs of crops. The agriculture is the backbone of India. The
farmer has to spend his more time in planting. But time available is less for him. Thus, it
requires more man power to complete the task within stipulated time which is costlier. Also
more wasting happens during manual planting .hence there is need of developing such a
machine which will the farmer to reduce his effort’s while planting.

        <h4><span>H</span>YBRID SILENCER</h4>
        <h5>Abstract</h5>
        <p>An Hybrid Silencer is mainly dealing with control of emission and noise in
            automobile exhaust. By using activated charcoal, perforated tube and outer shell it
            is constructed. An hybrid silencer is fitted to the exhaust pipe of engine. The
            activated charcoal filters the harmful sulphur and nitrous content produced from the
            engine. Sound produced under water is less hearable than it produced in
            atmosphere. This mainly because of small sprockets in water molecules, which
            lowers its amplitude thus, lowers the sound level. Because of this property water is
            used in this silencer and hence its name Hybrid SILENCER. It is tested in single
            cylinder 4- stroke petrol engine and the noise and smoke level is considerable less
            than the conventional silencer. The main pollutants contribute by automobiles are
            CO, UBHC, Nox and Lead etc., other sources such as electric power generating
            stations, industrial and domestic fuel consumption, refuse burning, industrial
            processing. So it is imperative that serious attempts should be made to conserve
            earth’s environment from degradation. An hybrid silencer is an attempt in this
            direction; it is mainly dealing with control of emission and noise.</p>
